# Quickfix: How to decrypt a mail without encryption add-on

Thanks to Thunderbird his last move, encryption through Enigmail add-on suddenly became impossible if you wanted to use well, an add-on to do it.

First, download the email from the mailbox, in Thunderbird base it's an .eml file ([about .EML extension](https://fileinfo.com/extension/eml)) that is downloaded

Then you need to install (hopefully one) and run two tools:

first is [uudeview](http://www.fpx.de/fp/Software/UUDeview/)

	sudo apt install uudeview

View your file content:
	
	uudeview [your_file.eml]
	
	Loaded from example.eml: 'Fwd: Example' (Fwd): encrypted.asc part 1   Base64
                                                                      
    Found 'encrypted.asc' State 16 Base64 Parts 1 OK

    -rw-r--r-- encrypted.asc   is OK   [d] (?=help) 

Press Y to say Yes

	Opened file example.eml
    	File successfully written to /home/x/Desktop/encrypted.asc     
      1 file decoded from 1 input file, 0 failed  

So now you have extracted the **encrypted part** of the message. You have an .asc file ([about .ASC extension](https://fileinfo.com/extension/asc))

Then, you run your [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/). This line above will give you a preview of the file in your terminal, remember that you'll need to send the stream into file to save it.

	gpg --decrypt [your_file] 
	
**Note**: At the bottom of the output, you have interesting information such as the date and time of the signature, the type of key used, the originated email address, a key fingerprint and so on.


**Tips**: In case your email and it's content is long, you can grab the top of the output by piping a less command:

	gpg --decrypt [your_file] | less 

To save the file:
	
	gpg --decrypt [your_file] > my_file

Now that you hace decrypted your file, you need to take a look in it to see of what it is composed. You'll use Uudeview again:
	
	uudeview [your_decrypted_file]

Press Y as many times as you want to see a file written in the specified format (look at the uudeview output) and you are good to go! 

Files are created in your folder. Now you are free to consult them.
