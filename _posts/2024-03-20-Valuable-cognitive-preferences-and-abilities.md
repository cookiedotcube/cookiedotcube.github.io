Individuals with visual-spatial cognitive styles excel at creating detailed diagrams and designing intricate solutions. Those with verbal-linguistic styles communicate effectively and articulate complex ideas clearly.

Moreover, this form of neurodiversity boosts creativity by encouraging individuals to think beyond the conventional norms. This resilience and perseverance are essential for navigating complex projects. The ability to view situations from multiple perspectives ensures that teams remain adaptable and responsive.
